# iOS App Architecture Best Practices: everything you need to know! ðŸš€

## Content

This repository contains the code sample I've used during May 19th & 26th's livestreams ðŸ‘‰ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HL-Jz6Stic

The repo is organized in two branches:

* [before](https://github.com/vincent-pradeilles/live-ios-app-architecture/tree/before) contains the code of a simple app, with no clear architecture in place
* [after](https://github.com/vincent-pradeilles/live-ios-app-architecture/tree/after) contains the code of the same app, with a much better architecture
